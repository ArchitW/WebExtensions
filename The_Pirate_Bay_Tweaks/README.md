An extension for thepiratebay.org which allows you to hide unwanted torrents, hide (or warn about) potential fakes based on some basic logic, add highlights so you can easily distinguish between different types of releases, and highlight your favorite uploaders.

By default red is used for torrents which contain an unwanted keyword,
Light blue is for torrents which contain a other keyword, (default = web-dl related),
Dark blue is for torrents which use the x265(HEVC) encoding library,
Green is for torrents which are by your favorite uploaders or contain a good keyword,
And torrents which could potentially be a fake are marked with a warning triangle.

Fake torrents are often by untrusted accounts, and have huge amounts of S/L shorty after they are posted. To help against this you can use 'Max seeds without trust', any torrent which exceeds this value in seeders will be marked fake (or completely hidden if you want). Obviously there is a chance of false positives using this method but it's better than nothing.

This can all be changed or completely disabled inside the options.
When you first open the options page all forms will be empty and you can start setting everything up how you want, but if you'd like to start with a default options setup there is a button for you at the bottom of the form. Clicking this will load a default setup which you can start adding to.
